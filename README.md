# UFOs

## Overview of Project

In this module we gathered data on UFO sightings that was stored as an array in a JS file. We received these filterable variables; date, city, state, country, and shape as well as these non-filterable variables; duration of sighting and a description of the event. We were asked to use JavaScript to create a table to organize our data and can filter the data based on our filterable values. 


## Results

The functionality of our website is fundamentally simple, starting with our blank search filter.

Using the data correlated to the right, we can type in commands to narrow our search. Examples are shown using each filter as well as multiple filters.

Our website also comes with a filter reset button to allow the user to refresh the search bars in an efficient manner.

Additionally, our website is conditionally formatted to be appeasing to the userâ€™s eye by using a dark background as well as a function that saves the element, value and id of the filter that was changed.


## Summary

One obvious drawback from our website is that it is extremely case sensitive. Both numeral and alphabetical inputs must be precise for the filters to function properly. Additionally, our shape filter leaves too much for interpretation to be truly functional. A drop-down menu for the shapes filter could be a simple remedy. Along with a drop-down menu for the shapes a basic calendar menu for the date filter would enhance the user experience.
